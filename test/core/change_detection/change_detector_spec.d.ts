/**
 * Tests in this spec run against three different implementations of `AbstractChangeDetector`,
 * `dynamic` (which use reflection to inspect objects), `JIT` (which are generated only for
 * Javascript at runtime using `eval`) and `Pregen` (which are generated only for Dart prior
 * to app deploy to avoid the need for reflection).
 *
 * Pre-generated classes require knowledge of the shape of the change detector at the time of Dart
 * transformation, so in these tests we abstract a `ChangeDetectorDefinition` out into the
 * change_detector_config library and define a build step which pre-generates the necessary change
 * detectors to execute these tests. Once that built step has run, those generated change detectors
 * can be found in the generated/change_detector_classes library.
