/**
 * An injectable service for executing work inside or outside of the Angular zone.
 *
 * The most common use of this service is to optimize performance when starting a work consisting of
 * one or more asynchronous tasks that don't require UI updates or error handling to be handled by
 * Angular. Such tasks can be kicked off via {@link #runOutsideAngular} and if needed, these tasks
 * can reenter the Angular zone via {@link #run}.
 *
 * <!-- TODO: add/fix links to:
 *   - docs explaining zones and the use of zones in Angular and change-detection
 *   - link to runOutsideAngular/run (throughout this file!)
 *   -->
 *
 * ### Example ([live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/lY9m8HLy7z06vDoUaSN2?p=preview))
 * ```
 * import {Component, View, NgIf, NgZone} from 'angular2/angular2';
 *
 * @Component({
 *   selector: 'ng-zone-demo'
 * })
 * @View({
 *   template: `
 *     <h2>Demo: NgZone</h2>
 *
 *     <p>Progress: {{progress}}%</p>
 *     <p *ng-if="progress >= 100">Done processing {{label}} of Angular zone!</p>
 *
 *     <button (click)="processWithinAngularZone()">Process within Angular zone</button>
 *     <button (click)="processOutsideOfAngularZone()">Process outside of Angular zone</button>
 *   `,
 *   directives: [NgIf]
 * })
 * export class NgZoneDemo {
 *   progress: number = 0;
 *   label: string;
 *
 *   constructor(private _ngZone: NgZone) {}
 *
 *   // Loop inside the Angular zone
 *   // so the UI DOES refresh after each setTimeout cycle
 *   processWithinAngularZone() {
 *     this.label = 'inside';
 *     this.progress = 0;
 *     this._increaseProgress(() => console.log('Inside Done!'));
 *   }
 *
 *   // Loop outside of the Angular zone
 *   // so the UI DOES NOT refresh after each setTimeout cycle
 *   processOutsideOfAngularZone() {
 *     this.label = 'outside';
 *     this.progress = 0;
 *     this._ngZone.runOutsideAngular(() => {
 *       this._increaseProgress(() => {
 *       // reenter the Angular zone and display done
 *       this._ngZone.run(() => {console.log('Outside Done!') });
 *     }}));
 *   }
 *
 *
 *   _increaseProgress(doneCallback: () => void) {
 *     this.progress += 1;
 *     console.log(`Current progress: ${this.progress}%`);
 *
 *     if (this.progress < 100) {
 *       window.setTimeout(() => this._increaseProgress(doneCallback)), 10)
 *     } else {
 *       doneCallback();
